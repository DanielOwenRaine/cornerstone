# Cornerstone - A Foundational Server-Side Framework in Rust

## Overview / Philosophy Behind Cornerstone

Welcome to **Cornerstone**, an ambitious open-source project aimed at creating a foundational server-side application framework. The thinking behind this project is as follows: Create a modular and foundational server library written Rust, this will be a collection of libraries that can be swapped in and out seemlessly with the projects goal of creating a comprehensive collection of libraries that covers most server use cases so that people can focus more on their creative endeavours rather than building systems that have already been built many many times in many many ways, remove the bottleneck to creativity in content for those who do not want to do the grunt work but just want to get a site running asap. Not only is this for tech noobies it will be aimed at higher level developers with more advanced tooling that can be opted in or out of to complicate or simplify each project you choose to build. 

Written in Rust, Cornerstone is more than just a codebase; it's an opportunity to contribute to a tool that will serve as a backbone for a multitude of web applications. 

## Features

Cornerstone is designed to offer a comprehensive suite of server-side functionalities, focusing on flexibility, security, and performance. Key components include:

- **Robust Migrations**: Efficient database schema management through a solid migration system.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure handling of user registration, session management, and permission controls.
- **Email Integration**: Email server setup for user verification and account recovery.
- **File Upload System**: User-friendly file uploading with an emphasis on security and scalability.
